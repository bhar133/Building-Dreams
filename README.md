Building Dreams is a mock website designed to allow customers to build and purchase their own personal computers. 
We used the Agile Development Cycle to create this product. 
This website was created using MySQL, Javascript, React, Node, CSS, and HTML.

We designed the product to function like a regular online store, with features like:
  - Multiple pages categorized by types of products
  - Step by step creation process
  - A saved cart that stays even if accidental refresh.
